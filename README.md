# Creating an alternative to Wordpress

## Cons of using Wordpress

- It's slow.
- Too much bloat.
- Ugly and old administration panel.
- It uses SVN for version control which is not as easy as Git.
- Updating the themes & the plugins isn't safe because it may break things.
- Themes and plugins:
- - Slow.
- - Too much bloat.
- - Ugly UI.
- Security (Installing a lousy plugin may destroy your whole website).
- People can continue to translate a theme or plugin.
- It has unused features and options that some people may never use. At the same time, it doesn't have the basic features for some use cases and people need to install 1 or a few plugins.

## Pros of using Wordpress

- Open-source.
- Community and resources:
- - Communities to ask for help.
- - Many free & paid tutorials.
- - Many free & paid themes and plugins.
- Easy to get started.

## What should we build

- Open-source.
- Easy and fully featured API support for building themes and plugins.
- A great documentation.
